# Aegis Agent Evolution Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This plan outlines the evolution of the Aegis Agent from simple IP-based blocking to a comprehensive segmentation and observability platform with process-level policies and impact analysis capabilities.

## 📋 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- Simple IP-based network blocking via eBPF maps
- Backend artifact polling and processing
- Native eBPF map updates (secure)
- Basic audit logging
- Minimal capability requirements

### ❌ Critical Limitations
- **Single Point of Failure**: One map controls all policies
- **Limited Policy Complexity**: Only IP-level allow/deny
- **No Impact Analysis**: Cannot predict policy consequences
- **No Process Context**: No process-level policies
- **No Observability**: Limited visibility into system behavior
