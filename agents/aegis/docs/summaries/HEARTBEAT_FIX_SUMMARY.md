# Heartbeat Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The agent was showing "Connection unhealthy, attempting reconnection" constantly because:

1. **Health Check Logic**: The `isConnectionHealthy()` method checks if `time.Since(lastHeartbeat) < timeout`
2. **Missing Heartbeat Update**: The `lastHeartbeat` time was never being updated when heartbeats were sent
3. **Always Unhealthy**: Since `lastHeartbeat` was always zero time, `time.Since(zero)` was always greater than timeout

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### 1. Update Heartbeat Time When Sending
```go
// In sendHeartbeat() method
wsm.healthChecker.mu.Lock()
wsm.healthChecker.lastHeartbeat = time.Now()
wsm.healthChecker.mu.Unlock()
```

### 2. Initialize Heartbeat Time on Connection
```go
// In connect() method after successful authentication
wsm.healthChecker.mu.Lock()
wsm.healthChecker.lastHeartbeat = time.Now()
wsm.healthChecker.mu.Unlock()
```

## ✅ **Expected Result**

After this fix:
- **Stable Connection**: Agent should stay connected without constant reconnection
- **Proper Health Checks**: Heartbeat monitoring will work correctly
- **Reduced Log Noise**: No more constant "Connection unhealthy" messages

## 🚀 **Deployment**

The fixed agent binary is ready:
- **File**: `aegis-agent-linux-arm64` (6.1MB)
- **Architecture**: Linux ARM64
- **Status**: Fixed and ready for deployment

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. Deploy the fixed binary to the Linux host
2. Restart the agent
3. Monitor logs for stable connection
4. Verify no more constant reconnection attempts

**The agent should now maintain a stable connection!** 🎉
