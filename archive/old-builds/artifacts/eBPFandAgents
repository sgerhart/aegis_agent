Great question. Think of an eBPF-based “host agent” as two parts: (1) a small kernel program (.o) you load/attach, and (2) a user-space daemon (your agent) that compiles/loads the program, manages maps/policies, and attaches it to the right hook (XDP, tc, cgroup, etc.). Here’s what you need on the host and what files your agent should carry or generate.

What the host must have (runtime & build)

Linux kernel with eBPF enabled

Kernel ≥ 5.4 is comfortable for CO-RE; newer is better.

Useful kernel configs: CONFIG_BPF, CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL, CONFIG_BPF_JIT, CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF, CONFIG_XDP_SOCKETS (if using XDP), CONFIG_NET_CLS_BPF, CONFIG_NET_SCH_CLSACT.

BTF available at /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux (most modern distros ship this).

bpffs mounted

mount -t bpf bpf /sys/fs/bpf (one-time; many distros do this automatically).

Capabilities/privileges for your agent

Typically needs CAP_BPF (newer kernels) or CAP_SYS_ADMIN + CAP_NET_ADMIN (common in practice). If running in a container, you’ll likely need --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_ADMIN or run privileged.

memlock limits

Raise or disable: ulimit -l unlimited (or set RLIMIT_MEMLOCK programmatically) so maps/progs can be pinned/loaded.

Tooling (for build or fallback)

Clang/LLVM to compile BPF C → ELF .o.

bpftool for generating skeletons and debugging (bpftool gen skeleton …, inspect maps/progs, pinning, etc.).

libbpf at runtime if your agent dynamically links it (you can also statically link or vendor it).

Kernel headers package (e.g., linux-headers-$(uname -r)) if you aren’t doing CO-RE. With CO-RE, you don’t need per-host headers—just BTF.

iproute2/tc if you attach via tc rather than via libbpf from your agent.

Short version: for production, aim for CO-RE + libbpf + BTF on the host, bpffs mounted, and the right caps. You can ship a prebuilt .o and avoid per-host compilation.

What files your agent should include (or generate)

A typical minimal tree:

agent/
├─ cmd/agentd/               # your daemon (Go/Rust/C)
│  └─ main.go
├─ internal/loader/
│  ├─ loader.go              # loads .o, verifies, sets rlimits, attaches, pins
│  ├─ attach_tc.go           # or attach_xdp.go / attach_cgroup.go
│  └─ policy.go              # parses policy JSON -> updates BPF maps
├─ ebpf/                     # BPF program & artifacts

File purposes

block_icmp.bpf.c – the tiny kernel program. Reads L2/L3/L4 headers safely, checks proto == ICMP and dst == 8.8.8.8, returns TC_ACT_SHOT (drop) or XDP_DROP.

vmlinux.h – generated once via bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c > vmlinux.h. Lets your BPF C code use kernel structs in a CO-RE-safe way.

*.bpf.o – compiled with clang -target bpf and shipped with your agent.

*.skel.h – a convenience header generated by bpftool to make attaching/loading simple in C/Go (via cgo) without hand-writing libbpf boilerplate.

rules.json – your user-space policy source; agent converts these into map entries.

loader.go / attach_tc.go – sets rlimits, loads .o, creates pins under /sys/fs/bpf/<yourapp>/…, attaches to the chosen hook (tc ingress/egress or XDP), and updates maps when policy changes.

Choosing the hook for “block ICMP to 8.8.8.8”

TC (clsact ingress/egress): Works on any NIC, both directions. Good for L3/L4 filtering.

Setup: tc qdisc add dev eth0 clsact (once), then attach program to ingress/egress via libbpf or tc filter add … bpf da obj block_icmp.bpf.o sec tc_ingress.

XDP (ingress only): Very fast, but only ingress. Great if you only need to block incoming or very early drop.

cgroup hooks (cgroup/skb, cgroup/getsockopt, etc.): Useful for per-cgroup/container policy.

For your “block ICMP to 8.8.8.8” example, TC egress (and optionally ingress) is the simplest mental model if you want to prevent outbound pings.

Minimal logic your BPF program needs

Parse Ethernet → IPv4 headers safely (bounds checks, bpf_ntohs, etc.).

Check iph->protocol == IPPROTO_ICMP.

Compare iph->daddr to htonl(0x08080808) (8.8.8.8 in network order).

Return TC_ACT_SHOT (tc) or XDP_DROP (xdp) to block, otherwise TC_ACT_OK/XDP_PASS.

You can hardcode 8.8.8.8 initially, or better: store targets in a BPF map:

BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH keyed by IPv4 address (u32) → action (u8).

Your agent loads rules.json, converts to net-order u32, calls bpf_map_update_elem() (via libbpf) to insert {dst=8.8.8.8 → DROP}.

This lets you add multiple IPs or protocols without recompiling.

Runtime steps your agent should perform

Ensure bpffs is mounted and memlock raised.

Load the .o with libbpf (CO-RE), check verifier logs for errors.

Create/pin maps under /sys/fs/bpf/aegis/… (or your namespace).

Attach program to tc ingress/egress on selected interfaces (or XDP).

Parse rules.json and populate the destination-IP map and (optionally) a protocol map.

Expose health/metrics (map counters) and a way to hot-reload policy (SIGHUP or API).

On shutdown: detach, unpin if desired, or leave maps pinned for zero-downtime reloads.

Practical gotchas to account for

Endian & alignment: Always use helpers (bpf_ntohs, bpf_ntohl) and do bounds checks.

Verifier limits: Keep loops bounded, avoid variable-length parsing; prefer fixed offsets or bpf_skb_load_bytes().

Interface selection: Make sure you attach to the actual egress device path your packets take (bridges/VLANs/bonds can surprise you).

Network namespaces: If targeting containers, you may need to attach within the right netns or use cgroup hooks.

Kernel lockdown/LSM: Some secure-boot/lockdown modes can restrict BPF.

Permissions in containers: You need the caps mentioned above even if the host is fine.

Quick “files you need” checklist

 block_icmp.bpf.c (CO-RE eBPF source)

 vmlinux.h (once, for CO-RE)

 block_icmp.bpf.o (prebuilt, shipped with agent)

 (optional) block_icmp.skel.h (bpftool-generated)

 Agent binary (links libbpf, loads & attaches program)

 Policy file(s) like rules.json

 Systemd unit or init script to run agent at boot

 Install/bootstrap script to mount bpffs, set ulimit -l, add tc clsact qdisc

If you want, I can drop in a tiny CO-RE tc program and a Go (or C) loader that blocks ICMP to 8.8.8.8 and reads a JSON policy so you can run it end-to-end.
